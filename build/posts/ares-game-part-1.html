<p>This is the&nbsp;start of&nbsp;what I&nbsp;hope to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;long story.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have been wanting to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;proper open world mmo rpg for&nbsp;a very long time. I&nbsp;have started two or&nbsp;three times in&nbsp;the past, but after a&nbsp;few weeks of&nbsp;work and&nbsp;failures, the&nbsp;projects fizzled.</p>
<p>This time, I&nbsp;am trying to&nbsp;be more realistic. Instead of&nbsp;overwhelming myself with complex features early on, I&nbsp;am starting with the&nbsp;basics, and&nbsp;will build upon those.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;challenge myself even more, I&nbsp;will be using C++‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have only ever created one game in&nbsp;C before and&nbsp;many parts of&nbsp;C++ are a&nbsp;mystery to&nbsp;me, but through this project, I&nbsp;have already learned quite a&nbsp;lot, and&nbsp;I hope to&nbsp;learn much more.</p>
<p>Because this game will be very open, I&nbsp;am working on&nbsp;the different features of&nbsp;the game first, no storyline, no fancy graphics, etc.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;start with the&nbsp;difficult parts first, then add in&nbsp;the details.</p>
<h4>Parts of&nbsp;the game I&nbsp;have created so far:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Isometric 2D World Rendering (multiple layers)</li>
<li>Simple creature/character rendering with movement animation</li>
<li>Pathfinding / Viewport control</li>
<li>Simple chat system</li>
<li><abbr>NPC</abbr>'s to&nbsp;communicate with</li>
<li>Naive multiplayer. Can currently exist in&nbsp;the same world, see each other, move around, and&nbsp;attack</li>
<li>Mob nests and&nbsp;mob creatures which drop items</li>
<li>Player inventory</li>
<li>Simple combat system (works over network)</li>
<li>Tilemap/World editor for&nbsp;creating and&nbsp;updating maps</li>
<li>Skill trees</li>
<li>Quests (only hunting quests currently)</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts to&nbsp;use menus and&nbsp;skills (will customize later)</li>
<li>Resource scavenging</li>
<li>Item crafting using resources</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like a&nbsp;lot‚Ä¶ for&nbsp;me. But there is still so much to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;my <abbr>ALPHA</abbr> version, I&nbsp;still want to&nbsp;have simple PvP, a&nbsp;vendor system, and&nbsp;player respawn working.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;think with all these things working together, I&nbsp;can testing with other people and&nbsp;get a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;what feels right and&nbsp;what I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;tweak.</p>
<p>Like I&nbsp;said, no story or&nbsp;theme yet, but I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;share the&nbsp;main features that distinguish. Yes, I&nbsp;know none of&nbsp;these ideas are unique, but I&nbsp;hope used together properly, they will make an&nbsp;entertaining mmorpg.</p>
<h4>Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Open world (walk <abbr>ANYWHERE</abbr>, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;get lost in&nbsp;the game üëç)</li>
<li>Attack almost anything (not sure on&nbsp;this one yet. I&nbsp;want it to&nbsp;be realistic here, but could cause real problems for&nbsp;eary players. Maybe make this a&nbsp;option a&nbsp;player can <abbr>TURN</abbr> ON&nbsp;PvP, or&nbsp;a designated <abbr>AREA</abbr>)</li>
<li>All items should be crafted / bought / sold by&nbsp;players (should force a&nbsp;real economy, must work together)</li>
<li>Player should be able to&nbsp;build structures (not sure on&nbsp;limits yet)</li>
<li>NO <abbr>LEVELS</abbr>. Improving in&nbsp;the game will be based on&nbsp;learning skills. You can learn skills from any profession in&nbsp;the game. The&nbsp;skill trees will be hierarchical</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>We keep sharing thoughts and&nbsp;updates. And&nbsp;maybe a&nbsp;video demo soon!</p>
