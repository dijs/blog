The&nbsp;idea is you can analyze your codebase and&nbsp;score each source file with a&nbsp;"bugginess".</p>
<p>The&nbsp;problem we are trying to&nbsp;solve here is to&nbsp;mitigate the&nbsp;common "Look's good to&nbsp;me" when code reviewing.</p>
<p>It is easy to&nbsp;understand why this problem exists. As&nbsp;any codebase and&nbsp;team grows, this problem grows in&nbsp;turn. With many developers changing source code over time, the&nbsp;learning curve for&nbsp;the codebase becomes more difficult. This problem can arise when the&nbsp;code reviewer does not fully understand the&nbsp;language, pattern, organization, structure, and&nbsp;history of&nbsp;the code.</p>
<p>Code history holds a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;knowledge. We humans would have a&nbsp;hard time holding the&nbsp;full history of&nbsp;a codebase in&nbsp;our head though… so let's automate it.</p>
<p>If we can figure out how buggy a&nbsp;source file is, a&nbsp;code reviewer can be confident in&nbsp;knowing how dangerous their "Look's good to&nbsp;me" comment will be. For&nbsp;example, if a&nbsp;file's bugginess score is very low, the&nbsp;reviewer can quickly look over the&nbsp;changed content and&nbsp;know that this file has rarely caused issues in&nbsp;the past. Although, on&nbsp;the other hand, if the&nbsp;file has a&nbsp;high score, the&nbsp;developer might want to&nbsp;ask for&nbsp;more developers to&nbsp;review the&nbsp;code being changed.</p>
<p>So how can we figure out the&nbsp;score of&nbsp;a source file?</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the original implentation, the&nbsp;algorithm used purely git commit messages to&nbsp;figure out if the&nbsp;files being changed were related to&nbsp;a bug fix. In&nbsp;my organization, we do not have that luxury. Our commit messages have evolved over time and&nbsp;we have used other tracking tools to&nbsp;communicate the&nbsp;purpose of&nbsp;code changes. Thankfully we have years of&nbsp;history in&nbsp;our tracking tool. And&nbsp;each story tied to&nbsp;code changes has a&nbsp;"type" we can filter by.</p>
<p>Now we have our commits related to&nbsp;bug fixes.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;score each file, we could just count the&nbsp;number of&nbsp;commits that changed said file. Although, a&nbsp;Google engineer came up with a&nbsp;fancy formula for&nbsp;value-over-time which we will use instead.</p>
<p><img src="http://www5a.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP1961d4c2f091817g7830000162bi7adedi5h9da?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=11&amp;w=130.&amp;h=39." alt="t = 0..1"></p>
<p>The&nbsp;commit time is normalized by&nbsp;treating 0 as&nbsp;the first commit time and&nbsp;1 as&nbsp;the current time. For&nbsp;each commit, this score is added to&nbsp;the changed file's total score.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;for the&nbsp;implentation, I&nbsp;used local git commands instead of&nbsp;hitting Github's <abbr>API</abbr> for&nbsp;two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed of&nbsp;commit searching and&nbsp;information retrieval</li>
<li>Did not want users to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;hassle with another <abbr>API</abbr> token</li>
</ul>
<p>After building the&nbsp;data, I&nbsp;sort it and&nbsp;output the&nbsp;result to&nbsp;a <abbr>CSV</abbr> file for&nbsp;ease of&nbsp;visualization.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;simply dragged it into Google Drive and&nbsp;created a&nbsp;chart in&nbsp;seconds, which showed where our dangerous code lived.</p>

<h3>Future Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrate more tracking tools</li>
<li>Use Github Issues as&nbsp;a source of&nbsp;data</li>
<li>Allow for&nbsp;custom <nobr>value-of</nobr>-time formulas</li>
<li>Modularize the&nbsp;commit gathering (choose local git, github, bitbucket)</li>
</ul>
