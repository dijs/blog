<p>During my&nbsp;day job, visualizing our development progress is very helpful for&nbsp;the team. Personally, I&nbsp;am not good at&nbsp;choosing which way to&nbsp;visualize this data, but once seen, I&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;value of&nbsp;them. We recently acquired a&nbsp;project manager for&nbsp;the team. He spent time creating charts of&nbsp;our sprint progress by&nbsp;hand, almost every day. While these charts were very useful and&nbsp;telling, my&nbsp;engineering brain could not let go of&nbsp;the fact that we should be able to&nbsp;see this, anytime, with any teams data. So I&nbsp;made it.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have started with only one graph. But I&nbsp;believe it is a&nbsp;important graph to&nbsp;have. It shows the&nbsp;progress of&nbsp;sprint stories over time. Our developers use it on&nbsp;a daily basis, during our stand ups. The&nbsp;project managers have been the&nbsp;key user of&nbsp;this project and&nbsp;have been very helpful. They can instantly find ways to&nbsp;make it more useful for&nbsp;them and&nbsp;the team.</p>
<p>Enough backstory, lets talk code.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal</a> here to&nbsp;track our stories (bugs, chores, features…) and&nbsp;they have a&nbsp;pretty decent <abbr>API</abbr>. I&nbsp;had used their <abbr>API</abbr> on&nbsp;many other occasions creating internal apps for&nbsp;our team. But this project seemed to&nbsp;be begging to&nbsp;be open source. I&nbsp;generalized the&nbsp;data gathering and&nbsp;processing as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I could. The&nbsp;filters in&nbsp;the app itself should work for&nbsp;any team. I&nbsp;stuck to&nbsp;a node app for&nbsp;ease of&nbsp;development, since I&nbsp;had already written a&nbsp;module for&nbsp;the Pivotal <abbr>API</abbr>. I&nbsp;got lots of&nbsp;practice with the&nbsp;use of&nbsp;<a href="http://underscorejs.org/">underscore</a> chaining for&nbsp;data processing. By&nbsp;finding the&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;filter/map/group your data, you can truly make your code pretty and&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;understand. The&nbsp;difficult part was actually transforming the&nbsp;data to&nbsp;work with the&nbsp;chart <a href="http://nvd3.org/">library</a>. By&nbsp;the way, if anyone can see a&nbsp;better way to&nbsp;transform the&nbsp;data, please let me know! The&nbsp;charting library I&nbsp;used was a&nbsp;powerful tool, but hard to&nbsp;find documentation for. I&nbsp;believe the&nbsp;project owner has switched/forked a&nbsp;few times.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>
<p>I&nbsp;believe this project can be expanded upon in&nbsp;a big way. I&nbsp;am sure many other teams have their own favorite graphs. I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;see the&nbsp;community help add those graphs. I&nbsp;plan on&nbsp;making a&nbsp;"dashboard" index page to&nbsp;show off all the&nbsp;graphs we currently manage. This is of&nbsp;course limited to&nbsp;teams who use Pivotal, but even that may be generalized out one day…</p>
