The&nbsp;best open source app I&nbsp;found was <a href="https://github.com/dae/anki">Anki</a>. The&nbsp;program was highly customizable and&nbsp;I found tons of&nbsp;free download-able decks online, full of&nbsp;study material. Downside was the&nbsp;mobile app. It was expensive and&nbsp;did not features I&nbsp;had seen on&nbsp;some other free flashcard apps.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;friend drew my&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flashcards/id478986342?mt=8">Flashcards</a> by&nbsp;<abbr>NKO</abbr>, which was a&nbsp;very fun app to&nbsp;use and&nbsp;it was free!</p>
<p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;use this new app for&nbsp;my mobile studying, but there was no way I&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;manually create hundreds of&nbsp;words…on&nbsp;my phone…</p>
<p>After doing a&nbsp;little research into the&nbsp;different applications deck file formats, I&nbsp;felt like hacking. Turned out that both apps just used compressed zip files as&nbsp;their outer shell and&nbsp;renamed the&nbsp;extensions. Anki used a&nbsp;complicated <abbr>SQL</abbr>ite database to&nbsp;store all of&nbsp;their information for&nbsp;each deck. I&nbsp;quickly was able to&nbsp;export the&nbsp;needed data rows (English and&nbsp;Hungarian columns) to&nbsp;a <abbr>CSV</abbr> file. The&nbsp;other app used a&nbsp;<abbr>FDK</abbr> file format, which archived a&nbsp;<abbr>JSON</abbr> (<abbr>YAY</abbr>!) configuration file and&nbsp;data files (Images and&nbsp;Sounds). This format was a&nbsp;bit harder to&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;first run through was simple, I&nbsp;just created a&nbsp;text-only version of&nbsp;my Anki deck. Worked like a&nbsp;champ!</p>
<p>Next big idea was to&nbsp;add images. Ugh… I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;English words, and&nbsp;I needed relevant images to&nbsp;pair them with. First tried with Google… Nope, they cut you off quickly with their <abbr>API</abbr> limits. After a&nbsp;few more tries, Flickr turned out to&nbsp;be the&nbsp;best, and&nbsp;the easiest to&nbsp;use. Now I&nbsp;had the&nbsp;images and&nbsp;the word pair data.</p>
<p>Generating the&nbsp;<abbr>JSON</abbr> configuration file took a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;figure out. Turned out they only allow you to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;max of&nbsp;100 card decks in&nbsp;the free version of&nbsp;the app. I&nbsp;modified my&nbsp;conversion app to&nbsp;iterate through each word pair and&nbsp;link the&nbsp;images.</p>
<p>End result was awesome. Tons of&nbsp;pretty cards to&nbsp;flip through. Now to&nbsp;practice…</p>
<p>I&nbsp;was planning on&nbsp;released the&nbsp;source code of&nbsp;this project, was it became <abbr>VERY</abbr> domain specific. If anyone has a&nbsp;need for&nbsp;this source, please just <a href="mailto:richard.vanderdys@gmail.com">email</a> me. I&nbsp;would be happy to&nbsp;give it out.</p>
