Although, most of&nbsp;the time the&nbsp;data is not directly usable for&nbsp;other purposes than reading. With so many <abbr>HTML</abbr> parsing libraries out there, it is common practice to&nbsp;build an&nbsp;application for&nbsp;a particular site and&nbsp;a specific data set. Parsz tries to&nbsp;generalize the&nbsp;"parsing" and&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the data structure you need. Instead of&nbsp;downloading, processing, and&nbsp;transforming the&nbsp;data each time you need to&nbsp;parse a&nbsp;web page, use parsz. Enough of&nbsp;the TV commercial…</p>
<p>I&nbsp;did <abbr>NOT</abbr> originally think of&nbsp;this. <a href="https://github.com/fizx/parsley/">This guy</a> did. I&nbsp;saw it, thought it was a&nbsp;great idea and&nbsp;decided such a&nbsp;simple idea could be implemented much easier by&nbsp;using Node.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;idea that caught me was to&nbsp;not <nobr>re-implement</nobr> the&nbsp;same dang code over and&nbsp;over again (possibly with stupid mistakes) in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;preform data parsing on&nbsp;a web page. Looking back, it makes me feel stupid. <abbr>HTML</abbr> has for&nbsp;the most part, been standardized. Why did I&nbsp;never think to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;engine which would use data/element or&nbsp;data/attribute relationships to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;recipe for&nbsp;parsing needed data. I&nbsp;really like the&nbsp;notion of&nbsp;labeling the&nbsp;data by&nbsp;name and&nbsp;location and&nbsp;having "someone" else do the&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Since <abbr>JSON</abbr> has become very popular, I&nbsp;have not built in&nbsp;<abbr>XML</abbr> based output yet, although that may be just a&nbsp;npm module away.</p>
<p>There are many improvements and&nbsp;features to&nbsp;add, like regular expression support and&nbsp;custom functions. But overall, the&nbsp;tool/library (however the&nbsp;community decides to&nbsp;use it) is in&nbsp;a fairly usable state.</p>
